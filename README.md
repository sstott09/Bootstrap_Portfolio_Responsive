### Assignment One (Responsive Portfolio) (Non-Responsive - i.e., no Media Queries)

### Overview

In this assignment, I've created a responsive portfolio using media-query functions to make the page scalable for [980px], [768px], and [640px] size devices.

### Objectives

1. Copied the contents of `Basic-Portfolio` (the first homework solution) and pasted the mentioned files into the `Responsive-Portfolio` directory in GitHub. Cloned and downloaded onto my local drive.

2. Inside my local `Bootstrap-Portfolio` repo, I created an `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`. Also included is an assets directory holding the CSS and Images folders for my portfolio.

Note: Be sure not to include any dot files (e.g. .git, .gitignore) from the `Basic-Portfolio` repo.

Inside my `Responsive-Portfolio` folder, are written media queries at the bottom of `styles.css`.

    * Created three `@media screen` tags, each with one of these `max-width`s: `980px`, `768px` and `640px`.
        
Made the position of the header `static` (the default positioning) when the screen is `640px` wide. The header design takes up a lot of room; so I didn't want it to stick to the top of a small screen and leave no room for the rest of my site.

Included the `viewport` tag in each of my HTML files, to ensure the media-queries function worked as expected on mobile devices.


3. I've deployed my new Responsive Bootstrap-powered portfolio (now with media queries!) to GitHub Pages noted below.
