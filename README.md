Assignment One (Responsive Portfolio with Media Queries)
Overview
In this assignment, I've created a responsive portfolio using media-query functions to make the page scalable for [980px], [768px], and [640px] size devices.

Objectives
Copied the contents of Basic-Portfolio (the first homework solution) and pasted the mentioned files into the Responsive_Portfolio directory in GitHub. Cloned and downloaded onto my local drive.

Inside my local Responsive_Portfolio repo, I created index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html files. Also included is an assets directory holding the CSS and Images folders for my portfolio.

Inside my Responsive_Portfolio folder, are written media queries at the bottom of styles.css.

* Created three `@media screen` tags, each with one of these `max-width`s: `980px`, `768px` and `640px`.
Made the position of the header static (the default positioning) when the screen is 640px wide. The header design takes up a lot of room; so I didn't want it to stick to the top of a small screen and leave no room for the rest of my site.

Included the viewport tag in each of my HTML files, to ensure the media-queries function worked as expected on mobile devices.

I've deployed my new Responsive_portfolio (now with media queries!) to GitHub Pages as noted below.
